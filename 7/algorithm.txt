Rules:
------------
light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.
dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.
bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.
muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.
dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.
vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.
faded blue bags contain no other bags.
dotted black bags contain no other bags.

The colors are here nodes and the rules define edges:

                 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10| 11| 12| 13
light red      1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
bright white   2 |-1 | 0 | 0 |-1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0
muted yellow   3 | 0 |-1 |-1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0

faded blue     9 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |-1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |-3 | 0 |-5

The first problem gets solved by starting at the row "shiny gold" search for negative
numbers. Find the matching positive numbers in the columns found and do the same for
the found colors until no positive numbers could be found.

Start in row 5. column 5 and 6 has negative numbers. The edges lead to bright white and
muted yellow. Bright white add light red and dark orange. Muted yellow add also light
red and dark orange, therefore four different bags contain at least one shiny gold bag.

The second problem gets solved by starting at the row "shiny gold". Now we walk the other
direction. We search positive numbers and follow the edges forward. Shiny gold bags 
contain one dark olive bag, which contains four dotted black bags and three faded
blue bags. These sum up to 1 + 1 * (4 + 3) = 8. And in addition it contains two vibrant
plum bags which contain six dotted black bags each and five faded blue bags each. 
These sum up to 2 + 2 * (5 + 6) = 24. Both sums sum up to 32 bags within a shiny gold
bag.
